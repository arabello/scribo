# Task

Create page layout and components skeleton using shadcn/ui components adding new ones if not present
in the project.

The app is single page route (home) with the following layout full page:

- 3 columns
- 1st column has two parts:
  - top part: metadata
  - bottom part: suggestions
- 2nd column: scrollable full height text area
- 3rd column has two parts:
  - top part: Guidelines
  - bottom part: checklist

the app will also have a floating toolbar at the center bottom part over the 2nd column. For the moment
just add a simple button that does nothing.

Leave each section empty, just create the skeleton and add a title and a border for each section just to identify them.

Don't provide any business logic
