# Guidelines

1. **Clear objective and target audience**: Establish the objective of your blog post and the topic to investigate. It can be technical, inspirational, informative, problem-solving, or a practical guide. Define your audience (a developer? A designer? A CTO?) and remember to include details or examples that are familiar to your target. Try to identify the needs and expectations of your readers to create truly useful content.
2. **Create an engaging title**: Write an engaging title that captures the reader's attention and reflects the content of your blog post. Feel free to use [copy.ai](http://copy.ai) or ChatGPT for inspiration.
3. **Start with an engaging introduction**: The introduction must attract the reader's interest and provide a preview of the post's content. The introduction must contain:
   1. The **subject** of your post
   2. A **preview** of what you will address in the post
   3. Clues to engage the previously decided **target audience**
4. **Define the structure and logical organization of the post**: Structure your blog post coherently. Use an introduction to present the theme and an elaboration to deepen it, divided into paragraphs with descriptive headings to improve readability. Conclude with a summary and a call to action _(our goal is commercial: to be contacted!)_. When possible, prefer an **essay structure** (thesis, arguments, antithesis, refutation, conclusion), ideally in _problem-solution_ form.
5. **Include your point of view and examples about buildo**: One of our goals is to convey to readers who the person writing the post is, highlighting buildo's interests and values through practical examples of applying concepts within the company. The article must reflect the writer's and the company's point of view.
6. **Use a conversational tone of voice**: Even if you're writing technical content, create a dialogue with the reader. The **personality** of the article's author and their **point of view** on the issue being discussed must emerge.
7. **Use language consistent with your target and purpose**: Is it a technical article aimed at developers? Feel free to use technical terms and include code snippets. Is the same article instead dedicated to a commercial decision maker? Be careful with technical jargon and overly complex language; prefer clear and simple language understandable even to those outside the field, so that your content is accessible to everyone.
8. **Curate informative content**: Provide useful information, definitions, insights, or practical advice on the topic covered in your blog post. Draw inspiration from other articles and make the sources used explicit, creating a bibliography at the end of the article and inserting direct links to other external pages. Ensure the information provided is truthful and verified. Enrich your content with concrete examples or case studies that illustrate the concepts or solutions presented.
9. **Use bullet points and short paragraphs**: When possible, organize information in bullet points or numbered lists to make your post clearer and easier to follow, especially on complex topics. Use short paragraphs to improve the readability of your blog post and make the content flow better.
10. **Give titles to post sections**: Use descriptive titles to divide your post into clear and distinguishable sections. 3 or 4 sections, excluding the conclusion, are already a good number. Take example from already written articles to organize your structure.
11. **Use quotes or statistics**: Support your statements with quotes or statistics from authoritative sources to increase the credibility of your blog post. Always remember to clearly state the source and link the reference page.
12. **Formatting and readability**: Use clean and clear formatting, with readable font sizes and wide margins. Use **bold** to highlight the most important words and concepts and help content scanning. Do this already in the content draft; it will also be reviewed before publication.
13. **Conclusions and call to action**: Conclude your blog post with a summary of the main points and invite the reader to take a specific action (call to action) if appropriate. Each post will be closed with a generic call to action inviting people to contact us, but it can be customized for specific purposes (e.g., redirecting to the Bento site rather than buildo's commercial).
14. **Internal links**: Add internal links to other articles or resources on your blog to provide additional information and improve the user experience within the site. It's also useful commercially to encourage potential readers to browse the services we offer.
15. **Don't copy and paste entire paragraphs of text**: Avoid copying and pasting parts of text already published online, unless it's a brief quote; always make sure to **rework** the **content**. If you use ChatGPT, check that the same words aren't already widespread online; always personalize what is produced.
16. **Ideal length: 1000-1500 words.** It can be shorter if the content is mainly graphic, or longer if the topic is particularly complex. Take this indication not as a must but as a suggestion.
